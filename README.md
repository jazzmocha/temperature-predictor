# 5-Day Farenheit Average Program

Hi! I am Adrian, also known as ***jazzmocha***. 

I created a program that would get the average of 5 farenheit inputs to identify and/or predict the next temperature in celsius.

I created this program as a requirement for our programming subject, but thought of adding more features into it.

I also thought of adding this into GitHub as my first repository too, for others to see my work as a beginner and more in the future!
